### Definition
#### Asymptotic Complexity
1. Big O - upper bound
```
f(x) belongs to O(g(x))
if there exist c, x_0 > 0
such that f(x) <= c * g(x) for all x >= x_0
```

2. Big Omega - lower bound
```
f(x) belongs to Omega(g(x))
if there exist c, x_0 > 0
such that f(x) >= c * g(x) for all x >= x_0
```

3. Big Theta - tight bound
```
f(x) belongs to Theta(g(x))
if there exist c_1, c_2, x_0 > 0
such that c1 * g(x) <= f(x) <= c2 * g(x)
for all x >= x_0
```

#### Complexity classes
The concept of polynomial time leads to several complexity classes in computational complexity theory. Some important classes defined using polynomial time are the following.

1. P: The complexity class of decision problems that can be solved on a deterministic Turing machine in polynomial time.
2. NP: The complexity class of decision problems that can be solved on a non-deterministic Turing machine in polynomial time.
3. ZPP: The complexity class of decision problems that can be solved with zero error on a probabilistic Turing machine in polynomial time.
4. RP: The complexity class of decision problems that can be solved with 1-sided error on a probabilistic Turing machine in polynomial time.
5. BPP: The complexity class of decision problems that can be solved with 2-sided error on a probabilistic Turing machine in polynomial time.
6. BQP: The complexity class of decision problems that can be solved with 2-sided error on a quantum Turing machine in polynomial time.
