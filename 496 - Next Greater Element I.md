### 1. Problem Description
You are given two arrays (without duplicates) nums1 and nums2 where nums1â€™s elements are subset of nums2. Find all the next greater numbers for nums1's elements in the corresponding places of nums2.

The Next Greater Number of a number x in nums1 is the first greater number to its right in nums2. If it does not exist, output -1 for this number.

### 2. Solutions
#### 2.1 Solution 1
##### Analysis
If there exists a segment in the list where the elements are in a decreasing order: for example, [3, 2, 1], and the next element is greater than all of them [3, 2, 1, 5], then 5 should be the next greater number for 3, 2, and 1.

Steps:
1.

Runtime:
- T(n) = theta(n)
